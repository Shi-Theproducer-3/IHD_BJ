      <h1>InHouse BJ</h1>
      <p>Blackjack...<em>ya nasty</em>...Where anyone can win!</p>
      <div id="game-breakdown">
        <span>Playing the game is simple, click the <em>*Blob*(start)</em> button. It doubles as a reset button as well. Clicking the button will build a 6 deck shuffled shoe (a deck with 6 decks essentially, 312 cards total).
          You and the dealer will be dealt two cards, one of the dealers cards will be hidden.
          Click the <em>Hit</em> button if you have less than 17, the dealer has to hit until they have 17 (Also if you don't know the basics on when to hit/when not to hit in blackjack I would look at that).
          Once you have a total you enjoy click the <em>Stay</em> button and the dealer will draw his cards if he needs some! The dealer total along with your total will also pop up.
          Now you can do two things. 1. hit <em>New Hand</em> and continue your current game(shoe/deck). 2. hit the <em>*Blob*(start)</em> button again and reset the game.
